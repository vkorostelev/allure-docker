# Allure Report Dockerized
The actual version of the Allure 2 Report dockerized. Image uses fresh releases from [official repository](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2/releases) since the official [ppa:qameta/allure](https://launchpad.net/~qameta/+archive/ubuntu/allure) stale for 2 years. The main purpose of this image is to use it in CI pipelines to generate and run reports, but it can be used as a standalone tool.

## Usage
Dockerized version of Allure allows you to do the same as the original version except for open browser.

### Generating reports
To get generated "allure-report" folder on the same level as "allure-results" folder map folder where "allure-results" directory is located as a volume and set this folder as a container's working directory:
```
docker run \
 -it \
 -v /path/to/folder-with-results-and-reports:/results-and-reports \
 -w /results-and-reports \
 allure generate
```
Alternatively, you can specify results and reports folders individually:
```
docker run \
 -it \
 -v /path/to/allure-results:/allure-results \
 -v /path/to/allure-report:/allure-report \
 allure generate \
 /allure-results \
 --output /allure-report
```

### Serving reports
To serve results specify a path to your allure results and port on which you can access it:
```
docker run \
 -it \
 -v /path/to/allure-results:/allure-results \
 -p 3000:3000 \
 allure serve -p 3000 /allure-results
```
This command will generate a report from the result and serve it on address with provided parameters, on the example above, it will be [http://localhost:3000].

### Open generated reports
To open results specify a path to your allure report and port on which you can access it.
```
docker run \
 -it \
 -v /path/to/allure-report:/allure-report \
 -p 3000:3000 \
 allure serve -p 3000 /allure-report
```
This command will serve generated report on address with provided parameters, on the example above, it will be [http://localhost:3000].

## Build image
To build an image run the following command in the project root:
```
docker build -t allure .
```

### Build image with a specific version of Allure
To build an image with a specific version pass it into the argument `ALLURE_VERSION`, for example:
```
docker build --build-arg ALLURE_VERSION=2.13.9 -t allure .
```
The command from the example above will build an image with Allure 2.13.9 instead of the default version from Dockerfile
